MVP

- Implement 5 argument schemes, where critical questions of each are also argument schemes.
- On page load, generate a web of ~40 nodes that relate to each other via these argument schemes
- Have the computer draw from this store when taking its turns. At this point pretend that the store is fixed. 
- Have the user's attacks / defenses conform to this store
